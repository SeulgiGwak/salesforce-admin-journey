#### A feature license is assigned to the company with the purchase of a product, such as the Service Cloud User license for the Service Cloud product. A permission set is a collection of settings and permissions that give users access to various tools and functions.

#### Feature Licenses, such as Cloud User or Marketing Cloud User, can be found on the user profile page. These licenses enable features in addition to the User License, such as the Salesforce User License.

#### Which requirement should the administrator consider when creating a new user in a production Salesforce org?
- All usernames must be unique across all production orgs. If a company has a standard email domain(which is used as a username), an administrator needs to add an additional identifier in the email to make it unique
- All usernames must be in the form of an email address, but do not need to be an actual email.

#### A new employee is facing the login error. As an administrator, what should you do first to troubleshoot login error messages?
- Check the user's login history related list in the user record to get an understanding of what is causing the login issue.

#### To prevent a user from logging into Salesforce temporarily 
- Freeze the user's account. The license is still in use, but the user is not able to log in. When the employee returns from leave, you can simply unfreeze the account.
- Change the user's login hours still user can log in during the newly created login hours.

#### Deactivate the Salesforce user account who has recently left the company. What happens to the license?
- When a user license is deactivated, the license is reassigned to another employee in the company.
